# PepsPlorar Scan

I've prepped a simple block explorer, instead of making this yet another etherscan clone, i went ahead and made it a PEPE token specific explorer. 

It will allow you to query a wallet and if they have pepe it will return the balance, show pepe token specific information and and display the 10 most recent transactions.

Overall, a good exercise that helped me use React, how contract abis are needed to interface with smart contracts, some light styling all the while keeping it simple and light.
